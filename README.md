MovieDir
========

MovieDir is a Python-developed directory-index program. And that's about 
it.

What to do:
* JQuery - ADDED IN static/JQuery.js
* Be able to show a folders content with an arrow - DONE
* Search-able
* Order-able - DONE
* Be able to see sizes of both folders and files. There is a function 
called getFilesize in scan.py but I dont know how to implement it into 
the template
